Operating System simulation by Rohit Nutalapati.

A batch processing Operating System with a unique set of instruction set provided by Dr.M.H. Samadzadeh as a part of academic project using C++.  
Specifications of the simulation:    

The "System" :  
* has 4MB Memory and 64MB of Disk Space. 
* A single CPU with Context switching. 
* Uses PAGING techniques on both Memory and Disk. 
* Implements Priority Queues for processing jobs.

Execution: 

tb - batch file with all the programs without any errors.
tb+err - programs with induced errors.

Execution instructions:

*compile using g++ 

*execute:

./a.out tb
or
./a.ou tb+err

File with instruction set and other specifications to be attached soon.
